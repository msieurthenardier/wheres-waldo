## Naming Conventions

- **Slugs**: Lowercase, kebab-case, derived from title (e.g., "User Authentication" → `user-authentication`)
- **Sequence numbers**: Missions, flights, and legs use two-digit prefixes (`01`, `02`, etc.) for ordering

## State Tracking

States are tracked in the frontmatter or status field of each artifact:

| Artifact | States |
|----------|--------|
| Mission | `planning` → `active` → `completed` (or `aborted`) |
| Flight | `planning` → `ready` → `in-flight` → `landed` (or `diverted`) |
| Leg | `queued` → `in-progress` → `review` → `completed` (or `blocked`) |

## Conventions

- **Immutability**: Never modify legs once `in-progress`; create new ones instead
- **Append-only logs**: Flight logs are append-only during execution
- **Flight briefings**: Created before execution, not modified after
- **Debriefs**: Created after completion, may be updated with follow-up notes
- **Mission as briefing**: The mission.md document serves as both definition and briefing (no separate mission-briefing.md)
