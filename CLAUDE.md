## Project Overview

Where's Waldo is a maritime supply chain tracker for resources critical to AI manufacturing — semiconductors, lithium, rare earth minerals, and other key materials. It monitors global shipping routes and cargo movements to provide visibility into the AI hardware supply chain.

## Flight Operations

This project uses [Flight Control](https://github.com/flight-control/mission-control).

**Before any mission/flight/leg work, read these files in order:**
1. `.flight-ops/README.md` — What the flight-ops directory contains
2. `.flight-ops/FLIGHT_OPERATIONS.md` — **The workflow you MUST follow**
3. `.flight-ops/ARTIFACTS.md` — Where all artifacts are stored
